## [Map]

The last type of collection you'll learn about in this codelab is a map or dictionary. A map is a set of key-value pairs, designed to make it easy to look up a value given a particular key. Keys are unique, and each key maps to exactly one value, but the values can have duplicates. Values in a map can be strings, numbers, or objectsâ€”even another collection like a list or a set.

The map() function (which shouldn't be confused with a map or dictionary collection above) applies a transformation to each item in a collection.

```
fun main() {
    val peopleAges = mutableMapOf<String, Int>(
        "Fred" to 30,
        "Ann" to 23
    )
    peopleAges.put("Barbara", 42)
    peopleAges["Joe"] = 51

    println(peopleAges)
    peopleAges.forEach { print("${it.key} is ${it.value}, ") }
    println(peopleAges.map { "${it.key} is ${it.value}" }.joinToString(", ") )

    val filteredNames = peopleAges.filter { it.key.length < 4 }
    println(filteredNames)
}
```

Output:

```
{Fred=30, Ann=23, Barbara=42, Joe=51}

Fred is 30, Ann is 23, Barbara is 42, Joe is 51,

Fred is 31, Ann is 23, Barbara is 42, Joe is 51

{Ann=23, Joe=51}
```
